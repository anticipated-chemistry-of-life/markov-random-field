This directory shows a couple of tests to validate the MRF model. See [here](https://anticipated-chemistry-of-life.github.io/acol-dws/notes/ufdb3a64xjinl5jopn58g8q/)

- In the [single root](./single_root) directory, the species tree has a single root and only leaves that are directly linked to the root.
- In the [balanced tree](./balanced_tree) directory, the species tree has a single root and always two children per node.
- In the [convergence_bigger_tree](./convergence_bigger_tree) directory, the species and the molecules tree are bit more complex. This directory was used to check if the model converges with a bigger tree and if it did, after how many iterations.
